This project aims to develop a machine learning-based classification model to identify different types of glass based on their chemical properties. The classification of glass plays a crucial role in forensic investigations and industrial quality control, especially in scenarios where identifying the origin or category of glass fragments can provide significant insights. The dataset used for this project is the Glass Identification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 214 instances with nine features representing the refractive index and concentrations of various elements such as sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), barium (Ba), and iron (Fe). Each record is labeled with a glass type, including categories such as building windows (float and non-float processed), vehicle windows, containers, tableware, and headlamps. The workflow involves detailed preprocessing steps including handling missing values, feature scaling, and normalization, followed by exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between features. Multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning was also carried out to improve model performance. The project includes comprehensive visualizations for better understanding of data trends, feature importance, and classification boundaries. The final model can be utilized as a decision-support tool in forensic laboratories or industries dealing with glass manufacturing and recycling. All code is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib, and the project is structured in a way that is easy to extend and adapt to other classification tasks involving material properties.
